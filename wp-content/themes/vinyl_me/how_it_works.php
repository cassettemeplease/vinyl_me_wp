          <h2>Our Philosophy: The Cassette Thrives</h2>
          <p>Cassette Me, Please is a cassette of the month club that believes in the power of rewinding and fast forward as an art form. For us, cassettes aren't just something we listen to, it’s a literal part of us. We believe that tapes are meant to be connected with and enjoyed as a complete work of art. Cassettes, as a medium, creates an environment for rewinding and fast forward which develops a connection through deep, active listening…the music as the focus, rather than just background hiss of the tape player.</p>
          <p>Each month we feature one cassette tape that is worthy of your time & attention. We package each record with a 2.5” x 4” cassette-inspired art print and custom non-alchoalic cocktail pairing recipe and send it to your door stoop.</p>

          <h2>The Perfect Picking Process</h2>
          <p>Over the course of a year we feature a broad spectrum of better than great music. We want to highlight new artists, essential releases from artists you may have heard of before, as well as a healthy dose of must-have reissues from decades past.</p>
          <p>We’re constantly listening to new music and looking for albums that are complete works of art from start to finish. We don’t want just one or two great tracks, but entire albums that are worthy of taking up precious space on your shelf - the kind people will fight over when you die.</p>
          <p>Over the course of your membership, you’re likely to receive a wide variety of music, spanning various genres, times periods, and artists. You may not have heard of every artist or record, but you can bet your ass it will be worthy of multiple spins.</p>
          <p>We work closely with both the label and the artist to come up with a truly special version of the record-- creating a pressing made exclusively for our members. Every Cassette Me, Please record comes with a unique feature set (custom lyric books, art, color cassettes, inserts) you can’t get anywhere else.</p>
